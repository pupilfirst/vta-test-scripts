            We tried to run the script using the command `node hello-world/index.js`,
            but some reason, we couldn't. Before submitting again, could you
            please verify whether your `hello-world/index.js` file contains
            valid JavaScript code? Also, please ensure that you run your script
            before submitting again.

            If this error persists, please ask for assistance on the
            **#wd-forum** channel on the Pupilfirst School Discord server, and
